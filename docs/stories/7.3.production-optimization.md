# Story 7.3: Production Optimization

## Status

Draft

## Parent Epic

[Epic 7: AI-Powered Story Generation]

## Dependencies

**Required (Must be complete first):**
- ✅ Epic 6: Story Mode (complete story generation system exists)
- ⏳ Story 7.1: OpenAI Integration Infrastructure
- ⏳ Story 7.2: Dynamic Story Generation Service

## Story

**As a** system administrator,
**I want** production-ready monitoring, caching, and rate limiting for OpenAI integration,
**so that** the story generation service is reliable, cost-effective, and performs well under load.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. In-memory caching reduces duplicate API calls for identical requests
2. Rate limiting prevents API quota exhaustion
3. Monitoring and logging track API usage, costs, and performance
4. Configuration allows easy adjustment of OpenAI parameters in production
5. Health checks verify OpenAI service availability
6. Documentation covers deployment, monitoring, and troubleshooting
7. Cost controls prevent unexpected OpenAI billing spikes

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement intelligent caching system (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create in-memory cache for generated stories by word list + theme hash
  - [ ] Add cache expiration to ensure content freshness
  - [ ] Implement cache size limits to prevent memory bloat
  - [ ] Add cache hit/miss metrics for monitoring

- [ ] Add rate limiting and quota management (AC: 2, 7)
  - [ ] Implement request rate limiting per minute/hour
  - [ ] Add daily/monthly usage quota tracking
  - [ ] Create circuit breaker pattern for API failures
  - [ ] Add automatic fallback when approaching quota limits

- [ ] Production monitoring and observability (AC: 3, 5)
  - [ ] Add structured logging for all API calls
  - [ ] Track API response times, success rates, and costs
  - [ ] Create health check endpoint for OpenAI connectivity
  - [ ] Add alerts for high error rates or slow responses

- [ ] Configuration management (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Externalize all OpenAI parameters (model, temperature, max tokens)
  - [ ] Add runtime configuration updates without deployment
  - [ ] Create environment-specific settings (dev/staging/prod)
  - [ ] Add configuration validation and safety checks

- [ ] Documentation and operational guides (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Create OpenAI setup and deployment documentation
  - [ ] Document monitoring, alerting, and troubleshooting procedures
  - [ ] Add runbook for common operational scenarios
  - [ ] Create cost management and optimization guide

## Dev Notes

**Production Considerations:**
- Next.js environment supports both client-side and server-side API calls
- Consider using Next.js API routes for OpenAI calls to protect API keys
- Implement proper security practices for API key storage and rotation
- Use existing project patterns for configuration and environment management

**Caching Strategy:**
- Use Map-based in-memory cache (no external dependencies)
- Cache key: hash of (wordList + theme + OpenAI model parameters)
- Cache TTL: 24 hours to balance freshness vs. performance
- Cache size limit: 100 entries to prevent memory issues

**Monitoring Integration:**
- Use existing project logging patterns and tools
- Track metrics that matter: API costs, response times, fallback rates
- Alert on: high error rates, approaching quota limits, slow responses
- Dashboard: API usage trends, cost analysis, performance metrics

### Testing

**Test Framework:** Vitest with performance and integration tests
**Test Location:** `__tests__/production-optimization.test.ts`
**Performance Testing:** Load testing with multiple concurrent requests
**Monitoring Testing:** Verify all metrics and alerts work correctly
**Documentation Testing:** Verify all operational procedures work as documented
