## Dev Notes

### Component Structure

**StoryIntroScreen:**
```tsx
interface StoryIntroScreenProps {
  introContent: {
    title: string
    narrative: string
    celebrationEmoji?: string
  } | null
  theme: string
  onStart: () => void
}
```

**StoryFinaleScreen:**
```tsx
interface StoryFinaleScreenProps {
  finaleContent: {
    title: string
    narrative: string
    celebrationEmoji?: string
  } | null
  wordStats: Map<string, WordStats>
  onPlayAgain: () => void
}
```

### Integration Pattern

```tsx
// app/story/page.tsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(storySessionMachine, {
  input: { wordList: demoWordList, theme: 'space' }
})

if (state.matches('showingIntro')) {
  return (
    <StoryIntroScreen
      introContent={state.context.introContent}
      theme={state.context.storyTheme}
      onStart={() => send({ type: 'START_STORY' })}
    />
  )
}

if (state.matches('finale')) {
  return (
    <StoryFinaleScreen
      finaleContent={state.context.finaleContent}
      wordStats={state.context.wordStats}
      onPlayAgain={() => send({ type: 'RESTART_STORY' })}
    />
  )
}
```

### Dependencies

**Required:**
- Story 6.4a (StorySessionMachine) ✅ Complete
- Story 6.4b (Story Mode Page) ✅ Complete
- Framer Motion (installed)
- react-confetti (installed)

### Testing

**Test Framework:** Vitest + React Testing Library

**StoryIntroScreen Tests:**
```typescript
describe('StoryIntroScreen', () => {
  it('renders intro content correctly', () => {})
  it('calls onStart when Begin Adventure clicked', () => {})
  it('displays theme correctly', () => {})
  it('shows loading state when content is null', () => {})
  it('displays celebration emoji', () => {})
})
```

**StoryFinaleScreen Tests:**
```typescript
describe('StoryFinaleScreen', () => {
  it('renders finale content correctly', () => {})
  it('calculates total words correctly', () => {})
  it('calculates mastered words correctly', () => {})
  it('calculates average confidence correctly', () => {})
  it('calls onPlayAgain when Play Again clicked', () => {})
  it('navigates to home when Exit clicked', () => {})
  it('shows confetti animation', () => {})
})
```

## Implementation Notes

### Components Already Created in Story 6.4b

Both StoryIntroScreen and StoryFinaleScreen were created as part of Story 6.4b implementation because they were required for the Story Mode page to function. This story (6.4c) was originally scoped to create these components, but they were implemented earlier in the development sequence to ensure the full story flow worked end-to-end.

**What remains:**
- Component tests for both screens
- Verification that all acceptance criteria are met
- Documentation updates

## Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2025-10-21 | 1.0 | Initial story created. Components already implemented in 6.4b. | James (Dev) |
