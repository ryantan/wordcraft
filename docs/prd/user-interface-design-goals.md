# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

WordCraft's user experience must balance two distinct user needs: **simplicity for parents** and **engaging playfulness for children**. Parents need a no-friction interface where they can quickly create word lists and check progress without reading instructions. Children need vibrant, responsive, game-like interactions that feel fun and rewarding, not educational-boring.

The design philosophy is **"invisible for parents, magical for kids"**—parents should barely notice the UI (it just works), while children should feel immersed in an interactive story-game world.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

**For Parents (Setup & Dashboard):**
- **Minimal Text Input**: Simple form for word list creation with inline validation
- **Glanceable Progress**: Visual indicators (colors, icons, progress bars) over dense tables or numbers
- **One-Click Actions**: Start session, view progress, export data—all accessible in 1-2 clicks
- **Familiar Patterns**: Standard web UI patterns (buttons, forms, cards) for instant familiarity

**For Children (Game Play):**
- **Touch-First Interactions**: Large, tappable elements; drag-and-drop; swipe gestures
- **Immediate Feedback**: Visual/audio feedback within 100ms of any interaction
- **Forgiving UX**: No penalties for mistakes; encouragement and retry opportunities
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple instructions shown just-in-time, not upfront
- **Playful Micro-Interactions**: Animations, celebrations, character reactions to maintain engagement

## Core Screens and Views

**1. Welcome/Home Screen**
- Simple landing page with "Create Word List" and "Continue Playing" options
- Optional: brief onboarding tour for first-time users

**2. Parent Portal - Word List Management**
- Create new word list (input form)
- View/edit/delete existing word lists
- Select word list to start game session

**3. Game Session Screen**
- Full-screen game play area
- Minimal UI chrome (just exit/pause button)
- Story mode narrative elements integrated into game flow
- Progress indicator (subtle, non-intrusive)

**4. Story/Transition Screens**
- Brief narrative moments between games
- Story checkpoint celebrations
- Character progression visuals

**5. Parent Dashboard - Progress View**
- Word mastery status grid/list
- Session history log
- Basic analytics charts (time spent, mastery rate)
- Export/import data options

**6. Session Complete Screen**
- Celebration of progress/achievements
- Summary of words practiced
- Options: continue, return home, view progress

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

- **Color Contrast**: All text and UI elements meet WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Parent-facing screens support full keyboard navigation with visible focus states
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px for all interactive elements (child-friendly and accessibility-friendly)
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear visual indicators for all state changes, not relying solely on color
- **Readable Text**: Minimum 16px body text; scalable without breaking layout

## Branding

**MVP Branding Approach:**
- **Clean & Playful**: Modern, friendly aesthetic using free design resources and component libraries
- **Color Palette**: Bright, cheerful colors for children's interface; calm, professional tones for parent interface
- **Typography**: Readable sans-serif fonts suitable for children (rounded, friendly) and parents (clean, professional)
- **Illustrations**: Free or low-cost illustration packs for story theme (e.g., space, adventure, fantasy)
- **Component Library**: Use Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui for consistent, polished UI components

**No Existing Brand Requirements**: This is a new project with flexibility to define visual identity during development.

## Target Platforms: Web Responsive

- **Primary**: Desktop browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge) at 1024px+ width
- **Secondary**: Tablets (iPad, Android tablets) at 768px-1024px width
- **Tertiary**: Mobile phones (iOS, Android) at 320px-767px width

**Responsive Strategy:**
- Mobile-first CSS approach using Tailwind CSS responsive utilities
- Game mechanics adapt to screen size (portrait/landscape support where appropriate)
- Parent dashboard optimized for desktop but functional on mobile
- Touch and mouse/keyboard input both fully supported across all screen sizes
