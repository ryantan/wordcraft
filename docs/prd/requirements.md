# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**Word List Management:**
- **FR1:** Parents can create a new word list by entering up to 15 words via a simple input interface
- **FR2:** Word lists are saved to browser local storage and can be retrieved for future sessions
- **FR3:** Parents can edit existing word lists (add, remove, or modify words)
- **FR4:** Parents can delete word lists they no longer need
- **FR5:** The system validates word inputs to ensure they contain only letters (a-z, A-Z)

**Game Session Management:**
- **FR6:** The system generates a game session from a selected word list, creating a queue of mini-games
- **FR7:** Each game session includes a mix of different game mechanics to maintain variety
- **FR8:** The session continues until the child exhibits confidence in the words, or the child chooses to end the session
- **FR9:** Session progress is saved automatically so users can resume if interrupted
- **FR10:** Users can restart a session or start a new session with a different word list at any time

**Game Mechanics (Minimum 8 types):**
- **FR11:** Word Scramble - Present scrambled letters that the user must rearrange to form the correct word
- **FR12:** Missing Letters - Display word with blank spaces where user must fill in missing letters
- **FR13:** Letter Matching - User matches individual letters to their correct positions in the word
- **FR14:** Spelling Challenge - User sees/hears the word and spells it letter-by-letter using on-screen keyboard
- **FR15:** Letter Hunt - User finds and collects letters in sequence within an interactive scene
- **FR16:** Trace & Write - User traces letter shapes with touch/mouse for kinesthetic learning
- **FR17:** Picture Reveal - Each correct letter reveals part of a hidden image related to the word
- **FR18:** Word Building Blocks - User drags and drops letter tiles to construct the word

**Adaptive Learning Engine:**
- **FR19:** The system tracks accuracy for each word across all game attempts to calculate a confidence score (0-100%)
- **FR20:** Words with low confidence scores (<60%) are prioritized for re-introduction within the same session
- **FR21:** Words with high confidence scores (>80%) are marked as "mastered" and appear less frequently
- **FR22:** The system implements spaced repetition logic to re-introduce challenging words at optimal intervals across sessions
- **FR23:** The system detects learning style preference by tracking performance across game types (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)
- **FR24:** Game selection adapts to emphasize game types that align with the child's detected learning style
- **FR25:** Game difficulty dynamically adjusts based on real-time performance (e.g., adding time pressure, reducing hints)

**Story Mode:**
- **FR26:** A lightweight narrative theme (space adventure, treasure hunt, fantasy quest, etc.) ties all game sessions together with beat-level storytelling
- **FR27:** Story beats advance the narrative through multiple beat types: game challenges, choice moments, narrative segments, and checkpoint celebrations
- **FR28:** LLM-generated story content creates contextual, word-relevant narrative for each beat (stub implementation initially, OpenAI integration later)
- **FR29:** Story progression is persistent across sessions and resumes from the last beat
- **FR30:** Visual elements (character, theme graphics) are consistent throughout the experience
- **FR31:** Story advancement provides positive reinforcement and motivation to continue playing
- **FR32:** Stage 1 presents words in story-coherent order (not random) for narrative flow; Stage 2 focuses on mastery of challenging words

**Parent Dashboard:**
- **FR33:** Parents can view mastery status for each word in a word list (mastered, in-progress, needs work)
- **FR34:** The dashboard displays confidence scores for individual words with visual indicators (colors, progress bars)
- **FR35:** Parents can view session history including date, duration, and words practiced
- **FR36:** Basic analytics show total time spent, number of sessions, and overall mastery rate
- **FR37:** Parents can export word lists and progress data for backup purposes
- **FR38:** Parents can import previously exported data to restore progress

**User Interface:**
- **FR39:** The interface is responsive and works on desktop browsers (1024px+) and mobile devices (320px+)
- **FR40:** All game interactions support both mouse/keyboard and touch input
- **FR41:** Visual feedback is provided for all user actions (button presses, correct/incorrect answers)
- **FR42:** Navigation between screens is intuitive with clear back/home/exit options
- **FR43:** The app provides a simple onboarding/welcome screen explaining how to get started

## Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance:**
- **NFR1:** Initial page load time must be under 2 seconds on a 4G connection
- **NFR2:** Game interaction latency must be under 100ms for responsive feel
- **NFR3:** Animations and transitions must run smoothly at 60fps on mid-range devices
- **NFR4:** The app must handle word lists up to 15 words without performance degradation

**Browser Compatibility:**
- **NFR5:** The app must work on Chrome 90+, Safari 14+, Firefox 88+, and Edge 90+
- **NFR6:** The app must work on mobile browsers (iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Mobile, Samsung Internet)
- **NFR7:** The app must gracefully degrade features not supported by older browsers with clear messaging

**Mobile Optimization:**
- **NFR8:** Touch targets must be at least 44x44px for easy tapping on mobile devices
- **NFR9:** Text must be readable without zooming (minimum 16px font size for body text)
- **NFR10:** Games must be playable in both portrait and landscape orientations where appropriate

**Data Storage:**
- **NFR11:** All user data (word lists, progress, confidence scores) must be stored client-side using localStorage or IndexedDB
- **NFR12:** The app must handle localStorage quota limits gracefully with clear error messaging
- **NFR13:** Data export must be in a standard, portable format (JSON) for easy backup and migration

**Privacy & Security:**
- **NFR14:** No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected or transmitted to servers
- **NFR15:** All data remains on the user's device for MVP; no cloud sync or server storage
- **NFR16:** The app must be served over HTTPS to ensure secure communication

**Reliability:**
- **NFR17:** The app must have 99% uptime (considering CDN and hosting provider)
- **NFR18:** The app must handle unexpected errors gracefully without losing session progress
- **NFR19:** Local storage operations must be wrapped in try-catch blocks to handle quota or permission errors

**Accessibility:**
- **NFR20:** Color contrast must meet WCAG AA standards for readability
- **NFR21:** Interactive elements must be keyboard accessible where applicable
- **NFR22:** The app should provide visual feedback for all state changes (loading, success, error)

**Code Quality:**
- **NFR23:** Code must be written in TypeScript with strict type checking enabled
- **NFR24:** Components must be modular and reusable to support adding new game mechanics
- **NFR25:** XState machines must be unit-testable and visualizable using XState Inspector

**Extensibility:**
- **NFR26:** The system architecture must support adding new mini-game types without requiring changes to core game session logic or adaptive engine code
