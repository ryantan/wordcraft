# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

Based on the WordCraft Project Brief, here are the desired outcomes this PRD will deliver:

- Enable children ages 5-10 to practice spelling through engaging, adaptive game-based learning
- Provide parents with a simple, no-setup-required tool to support their child's spelling practice
- Deliver measurable learning effectiveness through intelligent adaptation (confidence scoring, learning style detection, spaced repetition)
- Create an enjoyable experience that children voluntarily return to 2+ times per week
- Achieve functional completeness with 8+ game mechanics working smoothly with adaptive difficulty
- Ensure technical stability across browsers and devices with <2s load times
- Successfully integrate story mode to provide narrative continuity without interrupting gameplay

## Background Context

Traditional spelling practice for children ages 5-10 relies on tedious, repetitive exercises like worksheets and flashcards that children resist and parents struggle to make engaging. WordCraft solves this by transforming spelling practice into an adaptive game-based learning experience where parents simply enter a word list (~10 words) and the app generates a dynamic session of varied mini-games that adapt in real-time based on the child's demonstrated mastery.

The MVP focuses on client-side functionality with no authentication or server requirements, allowing rapid development and deployment. The core differentiator is the adaptive intelligence that continuously assesses confidence levels, detects learning styles (visual/auditory/kinesthetic), and strategically re-introduces challenging words using spaced repetitionâ€”making practice both effective and enjoyable.
