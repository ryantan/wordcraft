# Epic 8: Polish, Performance & Launch Readiness

**Expanded Goal**: Optimize performance for fast load times and smooth interactions, add animations and micro-interactions for delightful UX, ensure cross-browser and mobile compatibility, conduct comprehensive testing, and prepare the application for beta testing and public launch. This epic transforms WordCraft from a functional MVP to a polished, production-ready application that provides an excellent user experience. By the end of this epic, WordCraft is ready for real users.

5. Loading states use animated spinners or skeleton screens
6. Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility setting
7. Animation durations are appropriate: 150-300ms for transitions, 400-600ms for celebrations
8. Animations run smoothly at 60fps on mid-range devices

## Story 8.2: Optimize Bundle Size and Loading Performance

As a developer,
I want to optimize the application bundle for fast initial load times,
so that users can start using the app quickly, even on slower connections.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Next.js bundle analyzer is run and bundle size is reviewed
2. Initial JavaScript bundle is <500KB (gzipped)
3. Game components are lazy-loaded using React.lazy() and Suspense
4. Images are optimized using Next.js Image component with proper sizing
5. Unused dependencies are identified and removed
6. Code splitting is optimized at route level
7. Initial page load time is <2 seconds on 4G connection (tested with Lighthouse)
8. Performance budget is documented and monitored

## Story 8.3: Ensure Cross-Browser Compatibility

As a user,
I want the app to work correctly on any modern browser,
so that I can use it regardless of my browser choice.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. App is tested on Chrome 90+, Safari 14+, Firefox 88+, Edge 90+
2. All game mechanics work correctly across browsers
3. Touch and mouse interactions function properly
4. Animations and transitions render smoothly
5. localStorage and IndexedDB operations work reliably
6. CSS layouts render consistently (no browser-specific bugs)
7. Polyfills are added if needed for browser APIs
8. Browser compatibility is documented in README

## Story 8.4: Mobile Responsiveness and Touch Optimization

As a mobile user,
I want the app to work perfectly on my phone or tablet,
so that my child can practice spelling anywhere.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. All screens are tested on devices: iPhone (iOS 14+), Android phones, iPads, Android tablets
2. Touch targets meet 44x44px minimum size requirement
3. Drag-and-drop games work smoothly with touch gestures
4. Virtual keyboard doesn't obscure input fields
5. Landscape and portrait orientations both work well
6. No horizontal scrolling on any screen size (320px+)
7. Text remains readable without zooming
8. Mobile performance is smooth with no lag during interactions

## Story 8.5: Add Error Handling and User Feedback

As a user,
I want clear feedback when something goes wrong,
so that I understand what happened and how to fix it.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Global error boundary catches React errors and shows friendly error screen
2. localStorage/IndexedDB quota errors show helpful messages with recovery options
3. Network errors (if any) are caught and displayed
4. Form validation errors are clear and actionable
5. Success messages confirm important actions (save, delete, export, import)
6. Loading states prevent user confusion during async operations
7. 404 and error pages match app design and provide navigation back
8. Error logging is implemented for debugging (console logs for MVP)

## Story 8.6: Comprehensive Testing and QA

As a developer,
I want to ensure all features work correctly through systematic testing,
so that users have a bug-free experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Unit test coverage is >70% for core logic (algorithms, machines, storage)
2. Integration tests cover critical user flows: create word list → play session → view dashboard
3. All 8 game mechanics are manually tested on desktop and mobile
4. Adaptive engine is tested with simulated and real game sessions
5. Story mode progression is validated across sessions
6. Dashboard data accuracy is verified against known test data
7. Export/import functionality is tested with various scenarios
8. Regression testing is performed after bug fixes

## Story 8.7: Accessibility Audit and Improvements

As a user with accessibility needs,
I want the app to be usable with keyboard navigation and screen readers,
so that I can access all functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WCAG AA color contrast standards are met for all text and UI elements
2. Parent-facing screens support full keyboard navigation with visible focus states
3. Interactive elements have proper ARIA labels and roles
4. Form inputs have associated labels for screen readers
5. Error messages are announced to screen readers
6. Skip-to-content links are added where appropriate
7. Reduced motion preferences are respected
8. Accessibility audit using Lighthouse or axe DevTools shows no critical issues

## Story 8.8: Prepare for Beta Launch

As a project owner,
I want to prepare all documentation and deployment infrastructure for beta testing,
so that I can safely launch to a small group of users.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. README is updated with: project description, setup instructions, tech stack, contributing guidelines
2. User guide or help documentation is created for parents (simple markdown file)
3. Known limitations are documented (local storage, device-specific data, etc.)
4. Beta testing recruitment plan is prepared (target 5-10 families)
5. Feedback collection method is established (Google Form, GitHub Issues, or email)
6. Production deployment to Vercel is verified and stable
7. Simple landing page or about page explains WordCraft's purpose
8. Analytics are set up (Vercel Analytics or similar) to track usage
