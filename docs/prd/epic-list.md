# Epic List

Based on the WordCraft requirements, here are the proposed epics for MVP development:

**Epic 1: Foundation & Project Setup**
*Goal*: Establish Next.js project infrastructure, TypeScript configuration, XState setup, and basic routing with a simple health-check page to validate deployment pipeline.

**Epic 2: Word List Management**
*Goal*: Enable parents to create, edit, delete, and persist word lists using localStorage, providing the foundation for all game sessions.

**Epic 3: Core Game Mechanics (Part 1)**
*Goal*: Implement 4 initial game mechanics (Word Scramble, Missing Letters, Letter Matching, Spelling Challenge) with a shared game interface and basic session flow.

**Epic 4: Adaptive Learning Engine**
*Goal*: Build the intelligent core that tracks confidence scores, implements spaced repetition, detects learning styles, and dynamically adjusts game selection and difficulty.

**Epic 5: Core Game Mechanics (Part 2)**
*Goal*: Implement remaining 4 game mechanics (Letter Hunt, Trace & Write, Picture Reveal, Word Building Blocks) leveraging the established game interface.

**Epic 6: Story Mode Integration**
*Goal*: Create a lightweight narrative theme with checkpoints, visual elements, and progress persistence that ties game sessions together.

**Epic 7: Parent Dashboard & Data Management**
*Goal*: Provide parents with visibility into word mastery, session history, analytics, and export/import capabilities for data backup.

**Epic 8: Polish, Performance & Launch Readiness**
*Goal*: Optimize performance, add animations/transitions, ensure cross-browser compatibility, mobile responsiveness, and prepare for beta testing and launch.
