# 1. Introduction

## Project Overview

**WordCraft** is an adaptive spelling learning application designed for children aged 5-10. The application uses gamification, adaptive learning algorithms, and multiple game mechanics to make spelling practice engaging and effective.

## Current Implementation Status

**Completed Epics (Implemented):**
- âœ… Epic 1: Core Application Setup - Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- âœ… Epic 2: Word List Management - CRUD operations with localStorage
- âœ… Epic 3: Adaptive Learning Engine - Confidence scoring, spaced repetition, learning style detection
- âœ… Epic 4: Game Session Management - XState-based session flow, word selection
- âœ… Epic 5: Game Mechanics (8 games implemented):
  - Letter Matching
  - Word Scramble
  - Spelling Challenge
  - Letter Hunt
  - Picture Reveal
  - Word Building Blocks
  - Trace and Write
  - Missing Letters

**In Progress:**
- ðŸš§ Epic 7: Parent Dashboard & Data Management (Story 7.1 completed)

**Planned:**
- ðŸ“‹ Epic 6: Story Mode - Narrative-driven learning journey
- ðŸ“‹ Epic 8: Advanced Features - Sound effects, animations, accessibility

## Architecture Goals

1. **Simplicity First** - Client-side only architecture (no backend complexity)
2. **Offline Capable** - All data stored in browser localStorage
3. **Type Safety** - Strict TypeScript throughout
4. **Adaptive Learning** - Sophisticated algorithms without ML complexity
5. **Maintainability** - Clear separation of concerns, well-documented code
